Palazzo Pitti;"The Palazzo Pitti, in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace, is a vast, mainly Renaissance, palace in Florence, Italy. It is situated on the south side of the River Arno in Pitti Square, a short distance from the Ponte Vecchio. The core of the present palazzo dates from 1458 and was originally the town residence of Luca Pitti,[1] an ambitious Florentine banker.  The palace was bought by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief residence of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions. The Medici added the Boboli Gardens to the palace estate.  In the late 18th century, the palazzo was used as a power base by Napoleon and later served for a brief period as the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy. The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1919.  The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence. The principal palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square metres.[2] It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below. The interior of the Pitti Palace features a mixture of Renaissance, late Mannerist, and Baroque influences, while the exterior features colossal decorations, “Florentine arches,” and ashlar blocks symbolizing wealth. Over time, the palace was embellished with sumptuous frescoes, stucco work and intricate details by artists from different regions. As part of this intervention, elements of the Rococo and Neoclassical styles were included, further enhancing the architectural richness of the palace and creating spatial illusions within its grand halls. Although inhabited for about four centuries by three dynasties, the Medici, Habsburg-Lorraine and Savoy, the palace still bears the name of its first owner, Florentine merchant Luca Pitti, who had it built as his private residence in the mid-15th century. In 1473 Luca Pitti died, leaving Filippo Brunelleschi's design unfinished; the building then had only three wide doors and a double row of seven windows on the facade. In 1549 the palace, abandoned with the merchant's death, was purchased by Eleonora di Toledo, wife of Cosimo I de' Medici as a place of representation worthy of the grandeur of the nascent Grand Duchy. Bartolomeo Ammannati, the Grand Duke's favorite architect, enlarged the body of the façade, the back part, and behind the Palace the magnificent Italian Boboli garden was created. Pitti Palace Tuesday through Sunday from 8:15 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. It is closed every Monday, January 1 and December 25. The full ticket costs 10 euros; there is free admission for minors, people with disabilities, university students and journalists.";"The Palazzo Pitti, in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace, is a vast, mainly Renaissance, palace in Florence, Italy.

Ponte Vecchio ;"The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno, in Florence, Italy. The only bridge in Florence spared from destruction during World War II, it is noted for the shops built along it; building shops on such bridges was once a common practice. Butchers, tanners, and farmers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewellers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers.[3] The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie.  The bridge connects Via Por Santa Maria (Lungarno degli Acciaiuoli and Lungarno degli Archibusieri) to Via de' Guicciardini (Borgo San Jacopo and Via de' Bardi).  The name was given to what was the oldest Florentine bridge when the Ponte alla Carraia was built, then called Ponte Nuovo in contrast to the old one. Beyond the historical value, the bridge over time has played a central role in the city road system, starting from when it connected the Roman Florentia with the Via Cassia Nova commissioned by the emperor Hadrian in 123 AD.  In contemporary times, despite being closed to vehicular traffic, the bridge is crossed by a considerable pedestrian flow generated both by its fame and by the fact that it connects places of high tourist interest on the two banks of the river: Piazza del Duomo, Piazza della Signoria on one side with the area of Palazzo Pitti and Santo Spirito in the Oltrarno.  The bridge appears in the list drawn up in 1901 by the General Directorate of Antiquities and Fine Arts, as a monumental building to be considered national artistic heritage. According to historians, it was Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's pupil, who designed the reconstruction; he solved the problem of reducing the bulk of the structure to the outflow of water during floods, which ensured the building a life that we still enjoy today. In 1495, the municipality decided to sell all the workshops to private individuals: at this date there were 4 workshops, so the new owners began to raise them, divide the volumes, and advance on the stacks, each according to need and possibility without taking into account symmetries, balance and unity of design.
After the floods of 1547 and 1557, the owners had to rebuild the shops on the Ponte Vecchio at their own expense, once again aggravating and altering the symmetries.
In 1565, the Commune intervened, entrusting Giorgio Vasari with the task of redesigning the architecture; the Vasari corridor was born, radically transforming the image of the bridge, resulting in two different block heights. The central square on one side remained open as originally, on the upstream side it was closed with a three-arched portico necessary to support the aerial passage of Vasari's construction. Ponte vecchio is located at the intersection of the historic districts of Santa Croce, Santo Spirito and Santa Maria Novella. The stores located above Ponte Vecchio have the same address.";"The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno, in Florence, Italy.

Historically, the Ponte Vecchio played a central role in the city's road system, connecting Roman Florentia with the Via Cassia Nova, commissioned by Emperor Hadrian in 123 AD. Today, although closed to vehicular traffic, it remains a vital pedestrian link between major tourist areas, connecting Piazza del Duomo and Piazza della Signoria on one side with Palazzo Pitti and Santo Spirito in the Oltrarno on the other.£
The bridge has been listed as a national artistic heritage site since 1901 by the General Directorate of Antiquities and Fine Arts. Historians credit Taddeo Gaddi, a pupil of Giotto, with its reconstruction. Gaddi's design addressed structural issues caused by floods, improving water flow and ensuring the bridge's longevity.£
In 1495, the municipality sold all the workshops on the bridge to private individuals. At that time, there were four workshops, and the new owners began modifying them by expanding, dividing, and advancing on the bridge stacks without considering symmetry or design unity. After severe floods in 1547 and 1557, the shop owners rebuilt their structures, further altering the bridge's symmetry.£
In 1565, the Commune commissioned Giorgio Vasari to redesign the bridge's architecture. This project led to the creation of the Vasari Corridor, which transformed the bridge's appearance. The corridor introduced two different block heights, with the upstream side enclosed by a three-arched portico to support Vasari's aerial passage, while the central square on the other side remained open.£

Santa Maria Novella;"Santa Maria Novella is a church in Florence, Italy, situated opposite, and lending its name to, the city's main railway station, the square and the zone where it is situated. Chronologically, it is the first great basilica in Florence, and is the city's principal Dominican church.
The church, the adjoining cloister, and chapter house contain a multiplicity of art treasures and funerary monuments. Especially famous are frescoes by masters of Gothic and early Renaissance. They were financed by the most important Florentine families, who ensured themselves funerary chapels on consecrated ground. This church was called S. Maria Novella ('New')[1] because it was built on the site of the 9th-century oratory of Santa Maria delle Vigne. When the site was assigned to the Dominican Order in 1221, they decided to build a new church and adjoining cloister. The church was designed by two Dominican friars, Fra Sisto Fiorentino and Fra Ristoro da Campi. Building began in the mid-13th century (about 1276), and lasted 80 years,[1] ending under the supervision of Friar Iacopo Talenti with the completion of the Romanesque-Gothic bell tower and sacristy. In 1360, a series of Gothic arcades were added to the façade; these were intended to contain sarcophagi.[1] The church was consecrated in 1420. On a commission from the wealthy Florentine wool merchant Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, Leon Battista Alberti designed the upper part of the inlaid green marble of Prato, also called 'serpentino', and white marble façade of the church (1456–1470). He was already famous as the architect of the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, but even more for his seminal treatise on architecture De re aedificatoria. Alberti had also designed the façade for the Rucellai Palace in Florence. Alberti attempted to bring the ideals of humanist architecture, proportion and classically inspired detailing to bear on the design, while also creating harmony with the already existing medieval part of the façade. The combined façade can be inscribed by a square; many other repetitions of squares can be found in the design.[2] His contribution consists of a broad frieze decorated with squares, and the full upper part, including the four white-green pilasters and a round window, crowned by a pediment with the Dominican solar emblem, and flanked on both sides by enormous S-curved volutes. The four columns with Corinthian capitals on the lower part of the façade were also added. The pediment and the frieze are clearly inspired by antiquity, but the S-curved scrolls in the upper part are new and without precedent in antiquity. Solving a longstanding architectural problem of how to transfer from wide to narrow storeys, the scrolls (or variations of them), found in churches all over Italy, all draw their origins from the design of this church.";"Santa Maria Novella is a church in Florence, Italy, situated opposite the city's main railway station, from which it takes its name, as well as the square and zone where it is located.

Alberti, already renowned as the architect of the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini and his treatise De re aedificatoria, sought to harmonize humanist architectural ideals with the existing medieval façade.£
Alberti's design introduced classical elements, such as a broad frieze adorned with squares and the entire upper section featuring four white-green pilasters, a round window, and a pediment with the Dominican solar emblem. Flanking this are large S-curved volutes that solved a longstanding architectural challenge of transitioning between wide and narrow storeys. These scrolls, unprecedented in antiquity, became a model for church architecture throughout Italy.£

Piazzale Michelangelo;"Piazzale Michelangelo (Michelangelo Square) is a square with a panoramic view of Florence, Italy, located in Santo Spirito. This Florentine piazza was designed by architect Giuseppe Poggi and built in 1869 on a hill just south of the historic center, during the redevelopment of Oltrarno, the left (south) bank of the Arno river. In 1869, Florence was the capital of Italy and the city was involved in an urban renewal, the so-called Risanamento or the Renovation of the city's neighborhoods.[1] Lungarni (riverside walkways; ""lungarno"", singular) were built on the river banks. On the right bank, the fourteenth-century city walls were removed and turned into the Viali di Circonvallazione, mimicking French boulevard design, six lanes wide and lined with trees. On the left bank, winding up the hill of San Miniato the Viale dei Colli was built,[2] an 8 kilometers long street lined with trees ending at the Piazzale Michelangelo, which was built as a broad terrace with a panoramic city view.[3]
The square, dedicated to the Renaissance sculptor Michelangelo, has bronze copies of some of his marble works found elsewhere in Florence:[4] the David and the four allegories of the times of day at the Medici Chapel of San Lorenzo.[5]
Poggi designed the loggia in the neoclassical-style that dominates the terrace.[6] Originally it was intended to house a museum of works by Michelangelo. In the wall of the balcony, under the loggia, an epigraph in capital letters refers to his work.
The view captures the heart of Florence from Forte Belvedere to Santa Croce, across the walkways and the bridges crossing the Arno, including the Ponte Vecchio, the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, the Bargello and the octagonal bell tower of the Badia Fiorentina.[7]";"Piazzale Michelangelo (Michelangelo Square) is a square with a panoramic view of Florence, Italy, located in the Santo Spirito district.

The redevelopment included the construction of riverside walkways (lungarni) on the Arno's banks. On the right bank, the medieval city walls were replaced with the Viali di Circonvallazione, six-lane tree-lined boulevards inspired by French design.

Palazzo Vecchio ;"The Palazzo Vecchio (Italian pronunciation: [paˈlattso ˈvɛkkjo] ""Old Palace"") is the town hall of Florence, Italy. It overlooks the Piazza della Signoria, which holds a copy of Michelangelo's David statue, and the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi. Palazzo vecchio is situated on the district of Santa Croce
Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria, after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, this building was also known by several other names: Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori, and Palazzo Ducale, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno River to the Palazzo Pitti.
In 1299, the commune and people of Florence decided to build a palace that would be worthy of the city's importance, and that would be more secure and defensible in times of turbulence for the magistrates of the commune.[1] Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect of the Duomo and the Santa Croce church, began construction upon the ruins of Palazzo dei Fanti and Palazzo dell'Esecutore di Giustizia, once owned by the Uberti family. Giovanni Villani (1276–1348) wrote in his Nuova Cronica that the Uberti were ""rebels of Florence and Ghibellines"", stating that the palazzo was built to ensure that the Uberti family homes would never be rebuilt on the same location.[1]
The cubical building is made of solid rusticated stonework, with two rows of two-lighted Gothic windows, each with a trefoil arch. In the 15th century, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi added decorative bas-reliefs of the cross and the Florentine lily in the spandrels between the trefoils. The building is crowned with projecting crenellated battlements, supported by small arches and corbels. Under the arches are a repeated series of nine painted coats of arms of the Florentine republic. Some of these arches can be used as embrasures (spiombati) for dropping heated liquids or rocks on invaders.

Engraving of a map depicting the palazzo and square with the corridor, by Stefano Buonsignori, 1584
The solid, massive building is enhanced by the simple tower with its clock. Giovanni Villani wrote that Arnolfo di Cambio incorporated the ancient tower of the Foraboschi family (the tower then known as ""La Vacca"" or ""The Cow"") into the new tower's facade as its substructure;[1] this is why the rectangular tower (height 94 m) is not directly centered in the building. This tower contains two small cells, that, at different times, imprisoned Cosimo de' Medici (the Elder) (1435) and Girolamo Savonarola (1498). The tower is named after its designer Torre d'Arnolfo. The tower's large, one-handed clock was originally constructed in 1353 by the Florentine Nicolò Bernardo, but was replaced in 1667 with a replica made by Georg Lederle from the German town of Augsburg (Italians refer to him as Giorgio Lederle of Augusta) and installed by Vincenzo Viviani.
Duke Cosimo I de' Medici (later to become grand duke) moved his official seat from the Medici palazzo in via Larga to the Palazzo della Signoria in May 1540, signalling the security of Medici power in Florence.[2] When Cosimo later removed to Palazzo Pitti, he officially renamed his former palace the Palazzo Vecchio, the ""Old Palace"", although the adjacent town square, the Piazza della Signoria, still bears the original name. Cosimo commissioned Giorgio Vasari to build an above-ground walkway, the Vasari corridor, from the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, over the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. Cosimo I also moved the seat of government to the Uffizi.
The palace gained new importance as the seat of united Italy's provisional government from 1865 to 1871, at a moment when Florence had become the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Although most of the Palazzo Vecchio is now a museum, it remains as the symbol and center of local government; since 1872 it has housed the office of the mayor of Florence, and it is the seat of the City Council. The tower currently has three bells; the oldest was cast in the 13th century.";"The town hall of Florence, Italy, overlooks the Piazza della Signoria, which holds a copy of Michelangelo's David statue, and the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi.£ It is situated in the Santa Croce district.£
Originally named the Palazzo della Signoria after Florence's ruling body, the building has been known by other names such as Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori, and Palazzo Ducale, reflecting its diverse roles throughout history.£ It became known as Palazzo Vecchio when the Medici moved their residence to the Palazzo Pitti across the Arno River.£
In 1299, Florence's commune decided to construct a palace to reflect the city’s prominence and provide a secure seat for its magistrates.£ Designed by Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect of the Duomo and Santa Croce, it was built on the ruins of the Uberti family's properties.£ Historian Giovanni Villani noted that the Uberti were ""rebels of Florence and Ghibellines,"" and the site was chosen to prevent the family from rebuilding.£

Galleria degli Uffizi;"The Uffizi Gallery Italian: Galleria degli Uffizi, pronounced is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the district Santa Croce. One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best-known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance. T
After the ruling House of Medici died out, their art collections were given to the city of Florence under the famous Patto di famiglia negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa, the last Medici heiress. The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1769 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.[4] The building of the Uffizi complex was begun by Giorgio Vasari in 1560 for Cosimo I de' Medici as a means to consolidate his administrative control of the various committees, agencies, and guilds established in Florence's Republican past so as to accommodate them all one place, hence the name uffizi, ""offices"". Instead of dark, cramped and unhealthy spaces, Vasari had created a spacious and luminous square. The style adopted is classical - Doric - which alludes to the fairness of the Prince's government. The construction was later continued by Alfonso Parigi and Bernardo Buontalenti; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures. The cortile (internal courtyard) is so long, narrow, and open to the Arno at its far end through a Doric screen that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians[6] treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter, and architect as well, emphasized its perspective length by adorning it with the matching facades' continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the museum fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the Loggiato are filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.

The Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime artworks of the Medici collections on the piano nobile; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke Francesco I. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the Tribuna degli Uffizi that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a Grand Tour. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.[7]
Over the years, more sections of the building were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculptures collected or commissioned by the Medici. For many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.[8]";"The Uffizi Gallery (Italian: Galleria degli Uffizi) is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the district of Santa Croce.£ One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best-known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance.£

Basilica Santa Croce;"The Basilica di Santa Croce (Italian for 'Basilica of the Holy Cross') is a minor basilica and the principal Franciscan church of Florence, Italy. It is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 metres southeast of the Duomo, on what was once marshland beyond the city walls. Being the burial place of notable Italians, including those from the Italian Renaissance such as Michelangelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli, as well as the poet Foscolo, political philosopher Gentile and the composer Rossini, it is also known as the Temple of the Italian Glories (Tempio dell'Itale Glorie). The basilica is the largest Franciscan church in the world. Its most notable features are its sixteen chapels, many of them decorated with frescoes by Giotto and his pupils,[a] and its tombs and cenotaphs. Legend says that Santa Croce was founded by St Francis himself. The construction of the current church, to replace an older building, was begun on 12 May 1294,[2] possibly by Arnolfo di Cambio, and paid for by some of the city's wealthiest families. It was consecrated in 1442 by Pope Eugene IV. The building's design reflects the austere approach of the Franciscans. The floorplan is an Egyptian or Tau cross (a symbol of St Francis), 115 metres in length with a nave and two aisles separated by lines of octagonal columns. To the south of the church was a convent, some of whose buildings remain. The Basilica di Santa Croce is mixed style of gothic, renaissance and gothic revival. 
The Primo Chiostro, the main cloister, houses the Cappella dei Pazzi, built as the chapter house, completed in the 1470s. Filippo Brunelleschi (who had designed and executed the dome of the Duomo) was involved in its design which has remained rigorously simple and unadorned.
In 1560, the choir screen was removed as part of changes arising from the Counter-Reformation and the interior of this area was rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. As a result, there was damage to the church's decoration and most of the altars previously located on the screen were lost. The Bardi Chapel which contained a cycle of frescoes of the life of St Francis was plastered over, at the behest of Cosimo I, and Vasari placed some new altars against the walls, causing considerable damage to the frescoes.[3]
The bell tower was built in 1842, replacing an earlier one damaged by lightning. The neo-Gothic marble façade dates from 1857 to 1863. The Jewish architect Niccolò Matas from Ancona designed the church's façade, working a prominent Star of David into the composition. Matas had wanted to be buried with his peers but because he was Jewish, he was buried under the threshold and honoured with an inscription.
In 1866, the complex became public property, as a part of government suppression of most religious houses, following the wars that gained Italian independence and unity.[4][5]
Among the 19th-century restorations, the 16th-century altars and plaster were removed from the Bardi Chapel, revealing Giotto's frescoes of the Life of St Francis, which include the Death of St. Francis.

These restorations were later removed to reveal those areas which are definitively Giotto's, leaving portions of the painting missing.[6]
The Museo dell'Opera di Santa Croce is housed mainly in the refectory, also off the cloister. A monument to Florence Nightingale stands in the cloister, in the city in which she was born and after which she was named. Brunelleschi also built the inner cloister, completed in 1453.
In 1940, during the safe hiding of various works during World War II, Ugo Procacci noticed the Badia Polyptych being carried out of the church. He reasoned that this had been removed from the Badia Fiorentina during the Napoleonic occupation and accidentally re-installed in Santa Croce.[7] Between 1958 and 1961, Leonetto Tintori removed layers of whitewash and overpaint from Giotto's Peruzzi Chapel scenes to reveal his original work.[1]

The Primo Chiostro, the main cloister, houses the Cappella dei Pazzi, built as the chapter house, completed in the 1470s.£ Filippo Brunelleschi (who had designed and executed the dome of the Duomo) was involved in its design, which has remained rigorously simple and unadorned.£ In 1560, the choir screen was removed as part of changes arising from the Counter-Reformation, and the interior of this area was rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari.£ As a result, there was damage to the church's decoration and most of the altars previously located on the screen were lost.£ The Bardi Chapel, which contained a cycle of frescoes of the life of St Francis, was plastered over at the behest of Cosimo I, and Vasari placed some new altars against the walls, causing considerable damage to the frescoes.£
The bell tower was built in 1842, replacing an earlier one damaged by lightning.£ The neo-Gothic marble façade dates from 1857 to 1863.£ The Jewish architect Niccolò Matas from Ancona designed the church's façade, working a prominent Star of David into the composition.£ Matas had wanted to be buried with his peers, but because he was Jewish, he was buried under the threshold and honoured with an inscription.£ In 1866, the complex became public property as part of government suppression of most religious houses, following the wars that gained Italian independence and unity.£
Among the 19th-century restorations, the 16th-century altars and plaster were removed from the Bardi Chapel, revealing Giotto's frescoes of the Life of St Francis, which include the Death of St. Francis.£ This painting, missing sections where an altar had been attached to the wall, was heavily restored in the 19th century.£ These restorations were later removed to reveal those areas which are definitively Giotto's, leaving portions of the painting missing.£

Basilica di San Lorenzo;"The Basilica di San Lorenzo (Basilica of St. Lawrence) is one of the largest churches of Florence, Italy, situated at the centre of the main market district of the city, and it is the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III. It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD,[1] at which time it stood outside the city walls. For three hundred years it was the city's cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.
San Lorenzo was the parish church of the Medici family. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici offered to finance a new church to replace an eleventh-century Romanesque rebuilding. Filippo Brunelleschi, the leading Renaissance architect of the first half of the fifteenth century, was commissioned to design it, but the building, with alterations, was not completed until after his death. The church is part of a larger monastic complex that contains other important architectural and artistic works: the Old Sacristy (""Sagresta Vecchia"") by Brunelleschi and having interior decoration and sculpture by Donatello; the Laurentian Library by Michelangelo; the Medici Chapels, two structures that include the New Sacristy (""Sagrestia Nuova"") based on Michelangelo's designs; and the larger Cappella dei Principi (""Chapel of the Princes"") being a collaboration between the family and architects. The Basilica of San Lorenzo is considered a milestone in the development of Renaissance architecture. The basilica has a complicated building history. The project was begun around 1419, under the direction of Filippo Brunelleschi. Lack of funds slowed the construction and forced changes to the original design. By the early 1440s, only its sacristy (now called the Old Sacristy) had been worked on because that was being paid for by the Medici. In 1442, the Medici stepped in to take over financial responsibility of the church as well. After Brunelleschi's death in 1446, the job was handed either to Antonio Manetti or Michelozzo; scholars are uncertain which. Although the building was largely completed by 1459 in time for a visit to Florence by Pius II, the chapels along the right-hand aisles were still under construction during the 1480s and 1490s.
By the time the building was completed, aspects of its layout and detailing no longer corresponded to the original plan. The principal difference is that Brunelleschi had envisioned the chapels along the side aisles to be deeper than those built and he intended them to resemble the chapels in the transept, the only part of the building that is known to have been completed as Brunelleschi designed it.[2]";"The Basilica di San Lorenzo (Basilica of St. Lawrence) is one of the largest churches of Florence, Italy, situated at the centre of the main market district of the city, and it is the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III.£ It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD, at which time it stood outside the city walls.£ For three hundred years, it was the city's cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.£

Duomo di Firenze;"Florence Cathedral (Italian: Duomo di Firenze), formally the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower (Italian: Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore [katteˈdraːle di ˈsanta maˈriːa del ˈfjoːre]), is the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Florence. Commenced in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and structurally completed by 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi;[1] the basilica's exterior is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, and features an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival (west) façade by Emilio De Fabris. 
The cathedral complex, in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile, it is present in the district San Giovanni. These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major tourist attraction of Tuscany. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches and its dome, when first built back in the 15th century, was the largest ever built in western Europe. Although it was later overtaken by St Peter's Basilica, it still remains the largest dome ever constructed of bricks. The cathedral is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Florence, whose archbishop is Gherardo Gambelli.[2] Santa Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence's second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparata;[3] the first was the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze, the first building of which was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. Ambrose of Milan.[4] The ancient structure, founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs, was crumbling with age, according to the 14th-century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani,[5] and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city.[5] Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period, such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed.
The city council approved Arnolfo di Cambio's design for the new church in 1294.[6] Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio.[7][8] He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome, with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata. The first stone was laid on 9 September 1296, by Cardinal Valeriana, the first papal legate ever sent to Florence. The building of this vast project was to last 140 years; Arnolfo's plan for the eastern end, although maintained in concept, was greatly expanded in size.
After Arnolfo died in 1302, work on the cathedral slowed for almost 50 years. When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata, the project gained a new impetus. In 1331, the Arte della Lana, the guild of wool merchants, took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work. Assisted by Andrea Pisano, Giotto continued di Cambio's design. His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile. When Giotto died on 8 January 1337, Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348.

In 1349, action resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects, starting with Francesco Talenti, who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels. In 1359, Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini (1360–1369) who divided the centre nave in four square bays. Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi, Giovanni d'Ambrogio, Neri di Fioravanti and Andrea Orcagna. By 1375, the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down. The nave was finished by 1380, and only the dome remained incomplete until 1436.
On 19 August 1418,[9] the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri's dome. The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici. Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp. Brunelleschi won and received the commission.[10]
Ghiberti, appointed coadjutor, drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi's and, though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins, was promised equal credit, although he spent most of his time on other projects. When Brunelleschi became ill, or feigned illness, the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti. But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him. In 1423, Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility.[11]
Erection of the dome had begun in 1420 and was finished in 1436. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on 25 March 1436, the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar. It was the first 'octagonal' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame. During the consecration in 1436, Guillaume Dufay's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed.
The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral, begun in the 14th century, was left unfinished after the initial works done by Arnolfo di Cambio, which led Lorenzo de' Medici to initiate a design competition for the façade between 1490 and 1491.[12] The competition went ultimately nowhere, and the façade was not completed until 1887, when the polychrome marble façade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris. The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century.
The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara (white), Prato (green), Siena (red), Lavenza and a few other places. These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto's Bell Tower. There are two side doors: the Doors of the Canonici (south side) and the Door of the Mandorla (north side) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco, Donatello, and Jacopo della Quercia.

Bargello;"The Bargello, also known as the Palazzo del Bargello or Palazzo del Popolo (""Palace of the People""), is a former barracks and prison in Florence, Italy. Since 1865, it has housed the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, a national art museum. The architectural style is Gothic,  The first nucleus, facing Via del Proconsolo, already begun in 1255 (forty-three years before the Palazzo della Signoria), was built according to Giorgio Vasari by Lapo Tedesco next to the tower known as the Volognana, formerly belonging to the Boscoli family, and on some houses and towers of the Badia Fiorentina[1]. The Bargello is locate on the district of San Giovanni in the Via del Proconsolo, via Ghibellina, via dell'Acqua, via della Vigna Vecchia.

Construction began in 1255. The palace was built to house first the Capitano del Popolo and later, in 1261, the 'podestà', the highest magistrate of the Florence City Council. This Palazzo del Podestà, as it was originally called, is the oldest public building in Florence. This austere crenellated building served as model for the construction of the Palazzo Vecchio. In 1574, the Medici dispensed with the function of the Podestà and housed the bargello, the police chief of Florence, in this building, hence its name.[1] It was employed as a prison; executions took place in the Bargello's yard until they were abolished by Grand Duke Peter Leopold in 1786, but it remained the headquarters of the Florentine police until 1859. When Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor Peter Leopold was exiled, the makeshift Governor of Tuscany decided that the Bargello should no longer be a jail, and it then became a national museum.
The original two-story structure was built alongside the Volognana Tower in 1256. The third storey, which can be identified by the smaller blocks used to construct it, was added after the fire of 1323. The building is designed around an open courtyard with an external staircase leading to the second floor. An open well is found in the centre of the courtyard.[1]
