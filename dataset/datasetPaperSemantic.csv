Palazzo Pitti;"The Palazzo Pitti, in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace, is a vast, mainly Renaissance, palace in Florence, Italy. It is situated on the south side of the River Arno in Pitti Square, a short distance from the Ponte Vecchio. The core of the present palazzo dates from 1458 and was originally the town residence of Luca Pitti,[1] an ambitious Florentine banker.  The palace was bought by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief residence of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions. The Medici added the Boboli Gardens to the palace estate.  In the late 18th century, the palazzo was used as a power base by Napoleon and later served for a brief period as the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy. The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1919.  The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence. The principal palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square metres.[2] It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below. The interior of the Pitti Palace features a mixture of Renaissance, late Mannerist, and Baroque influences, while the exterior features colossal decorations, “Florentine arches,” and ashlar blocks symbolizing wealth. Over time, the palace was embellished with sumptuous frescoes, stucco work and intricate details by artists from different regions. As part of this intervention, elements of the Rococo and Neoclassical styles were included, further enhancing the architectural richness of the palace and creating spatial illusions within its grand halls. Although inhabited for about four centuries by three dynasties, the Medici, Habsburg-Lorraine and Savoy, the palace still bears the name of its first owner, Florentine merchant Luca Pitti, who had it built as his private residence in the mid-15th century. In 1473 Luca Pitti died, leaving Filippo Brunelleschi's design unfinished; the building then had only three wide doors and a double row of seven windows on the facade. In 1549 the palace, abandoned with the merchant's death, was purchased by Eleonora di Toledo, wife of Cosimo I de' Medici as a place of representation worthy of the grandeur of the nascent Grand Duchy. Bartolomeo Ammannati, the Grand Duke's favorite architect, enlarged the body of the façade, the back part, and behind the Palace the magnificent Italian Boboli garden was created. Pitti Palace Tuesday through Sunday from 8:15 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. It is closed every Monday, January 1 and December 25.

Ponte Vecchio ;"The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno, in Florence, Italy. The only bridge in Florence spared from destruction during World War II, it is noted for the shops built along it; building shops on such bridges was once a common practice. Butchers, tanners, and farmers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewellers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers.[3] The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie.  The bridge connects Via Por Santa Maria (Lungarno degli Acciaiuoli and Lungarno degli Archibusieri) to Via de' Guicciardini (Borgo San Jacopo and Via de' Bardi).  The name was given to what was the oldest Florentine bridge when the Ponte alla Carraia was built, then called Ponte Nuovo in contrast to the old one. Beyond the historical value, the bridge over time has played a central role in the city road system, starting from when it connected the Roman Florentia with the Via Cassia Nova commissioned by the emperor Hadrian in 123 AD.  In contemporary times, despite being closed to vehicular traffic, the bridge is crossed by a considerable pedestrian flow generated both by its fame and by the fact that it connects places of high tourist interest on the two banks of the river: Piazza del Duomo, Piazza della Signoria on one side with the area of Palazzo Pitti and Santo Spirito in the Oltrarno.  The bridge appears in the list drawn up in 1901 by the General Directorate of Antiquities and Fine Arts, as a monumental building to be considered national artistic heritage. According to historians, it was Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto's pupil, who designed the reconstruction; he solved the problem of reducing the bulk of the structure to the outflow of water during floods, which ensured the building a life that we still enjoy today. In 1495, the municipality decided to sell all the workshops to private individuals: at this date there were 4 workshops, so the new owners began to raise them, divide the volumes, and advance on the stacks, each according to need and possibility without taking into account symmetries, balance and unity of design.
After the floods of 1547 and 1557, the owners had to rebuild the shops on the Ponte Vecchio at their own expense, once again aggravating and altering the symmetries.
In 1565, the Commune intervened, entrusting Giorgio Vasari with the task of redesigning the architecture; the Vasari corridor was born, radically transforming the image of the bridge, resulting in two different block heights. The central square on one side remained open as originally, on the upstream side it was closed with a three-arched portico necessary to support the aerial passage of Vasari's construction. Ponte vecchio is located at the intersection of the historic districts of Santa Croce, Santo Spirito and Santa Maria Novella. The stores located above Ponte Vecchio have the same address.";"The Ponte Vecchio is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno, in Florence, Italy.

The Ponte Vecchio's two neighboring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie. The bridge connects Via Por Santa Maria (Lungarno degli Acciaiuoli and Lungarno degli Archibusieri) to Via de' Guicciardini (Borgo San Jacopo and Via de' Bardi). Its name, meaning ""Old Bridge,"" was given when the Ponte alla Carraia was built and named Ponte Nuovo (""New Bridge"") in contrast.£
Historically, the Ponte Vecchio played a central role in the city's road system, connecting Roman Florentia with the Via Cassia Nova, commissioned by Emperor Hadrian in 123 AD. Today, although closed to vehicular traffic, it remains a vital pedestrian link between major tourist areas, connecting Piazza del Duomo and Piazza della Signoria on one side with Palazzo Pitti and Santo Spirito in the Oltrarno on the other.£
The bridge has been listed as a national artistic heritage site since 1901 by the General Directorate of Antiquities and Fine Arts. Historians credit Taddeo Gaddi, a pupil of Giotto, with its reconstruction. Gaddi's design addressed structural issues caused by floods, improving water flow and ensuring the bridge's longevity.£
In 1495, the municipality sold all the workshops on the bridge to private individuals. At that time, there were four workshops, and the new owners began modifying them by expanding, dividing, and advancing on the bridge stacks without considering symmetry or design unity. After severe floods in 1547 and 1557, the shop owners rebuilt their structures, further altering the bridge's symmetry.£
In 1565, the Commune commissioned Giorgio Vasari to redesign the bridge's architecture. This project led to the creation of the Vasari Corridor, which transformed the bridge's appearance. The corridor introduced two different block heights, with the upstream side enclosed by a three-arched portico to support Vasari's aerial passage, while the central square on the other side remained open.£

Santa Maria Novella;"Santa Maria Novella is a church in Florence, Italy, situated opposite, and lending its name to, the city's main railway station, the square and the zone where it is situated. Chronologically, it is the first great basilica in Florence, and is the city's principal Dominican church.
The church, the adjoining cloister, and chapter house contain a multiplicity of art treasures and funerary monuments. Especially famous are frescoes by masters of Gothic and early Renaissance. They were financed by the most important Florentine families, who ensured themselves funerary chapels on consecrated ground. This church was called S. Maria Novella ('New')[1] because it was built on the site of the 9th-century oratory of Santa Maria delle Vigne. When the site was assigned to the Dominican Order in 1221, they decided to build a new church and adjoining cloister. The church was designed by two Dominican friars, Fra Sisto Fiorentino and Fra Ristoro da Campi. Building began in the mid-13th century (about 1276), and lasted 80 years,[1] ending under the supervision of Friar Iacopo Talenti with the completion of the Romanesque-Gothic bell tower and sacristy. In 1360, a series of Gothic arcades were added to the façade; these were intended to contain sarcophagi.[1] The church was consecrated in 1420. On a commission from the wealthy Florentine wool merchant Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, Leon Battista Alberti designed the upper part of the inlaid green marble of Prato, also called 'serpentino', and white marble façade of the church (1456–1470). He was already famous as the architect of the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, but even more for his seminal treatise on architecture De re aedificatoria. Alberti had also designed the façade for the Rucellai Palace in Florence. Alberti attempted to bring the ideals of humanist architecture, proportion and classically inspired detailing to bear on the design, while also creating harmony with the already existing medieval part of the façade. The combined façade can be inscribed by a square; many other repetitions of squares can be found in the design.[2] His contribution consists of a broad frieze decorated with squares, and the full upper part, including the four white-green pilasters and a round window, crowned by a pediment with the Dominican solar emblem, and flanked on both sides by enormous S-curved volutes. The four columns with Corinthian capitals on the lower part of the façade were also added. The pediment and the frieze are clearly inspired by antiquity, but the S-curved scrolls in the upper part are new and without precedent in antiquity. Solving a longstanding architectural problem of how to transfer from wide to narrow storeys, the scrolls (or variations of them), found in churches all over Italy, all draw their origins from the design of this church.";"Santa Maria Novella is a church in Florence, Italy, situated opposite the city's main railway station, from which it takes its name, as well as the square and zone where it is located.

Piazzale Michelangelo;"Piazzale Michelangelo (Michelangelo Square) is a square with a panoramic view of Florence, Italy, located in Santo Spirito. This Florentine piazza was designed by architect Giuseppe Poggi and built in 1869 on a hill just south of the historic center, during the redevelopment of Oltrarno, the left (south) bank of the Arno river. In 1869, Florence was the capital of Italy and the city was involved in an urban renewal, the so-called Risanamento or the Renovation of the city's neighborhoods.[1] Lungarni (riverside walkways; ""lungarno"", singular) were built on the river banks. On the right bank, the fourteenth-century city walls were removed and turned into the Viali di Circonvallazione, mimicking French boulevard design, six lanes wide and lined with trees. On the left bank, winding up the hill of San Miniato the Viale dei Colli was built,[2] an 8 kilometers long street lined with trees ending at the Piazzale Michelangelo, which was built as a broad terrace with a panoramic city view.[3]
The square, dedicated to the Renaissance sculptor Michelangelo, has bronze copies of some of his marble works found elsewhere in Florence:[4] the David and the four allegories of the times of day at the Medici Chapel of San Lorenzo.[5]
Poggi designed the loggia in the neoclassical-style that dominates the terrace.[6] Originally it was intended to house a museum of works by Michelangelo. In the wall of the balcony, under the loggia, an epigraph in capital letters refers to his work.
The view captures the heart of Florence from Forte Belvedere to Santa Croce, across the walkways and the bridges crossing the Arno, including the Ponte Vecchio, the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, the Bargello and the octagonal bell tower of the Badia Fiorentina.[7]";"Piazzale Michelangelo (Michelangelo Square) is a square with a panoramic view of Florence, Italy, located in the Santo Spirito district.

Palazzo Vecchio ;"The Palazzo Vecchio (Italian pronunciation: [paˈlattso ˈvɛkkjo] ""Old Palace"") is the town hall of Florence, Italy. It overlooks the Piazza della Signoria, which holds a copy of Michelangelo's David statue, and the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi. Palazzo vecchio is situated on the district of Santa Croce
Originally called the Palazzo della Signoria, after the Signoria of Florence, the ruling body of the Republic of Florence, this building was also known by several other names: Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori, and Palazzo Ducale, in accordance with the varying use of the palace during its long history. The building acquired its current name when the Medici duke's residence was moved across the Arno River to the Palazzo Pitti.
In 1299, the commune and people of Florence decided to build a palace that would be worthy of the city's importance, and that would be more secure and defensible in times of turbulence for the magistrates of the commune.[1] Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect of the Duomo and the Santa Croce church, began construction upon the ruins of Palazzo dei Fanti and Palazzo dell'Esecutore di Giustizia, once owned by the Uberti family. Giovanni Villani (1276–1348) wrote in his Nuova Cronica that the Uberti were ""rebels of Florence and Ghibellines"", stating that the palazzo was built to ensure that the Uberti family homes would never be rebuilt on the same location.[1]
The cubical building is made of solid rusticated stonework, with two rows of two-lighted Gothic windows, each with a trefoil arch. In the 15th century, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi added decorative bas-reliefs of the cross and the Florentine lily in the spandrels between the trefoils. The building is crowned with projecting crenellated battlements, supported by small arches and corbels. Under the arches are a repeated series of nine painted coats of arms of the Florentine republic. Some of these arches can be used as embrasures (spiombati) for dropping heated liquids or rocks on invaders.

The solid, massive building is enhanced by the simple tower with its clock. Giovanni Villani wrote that Arnolfo di Cambio incorporated the ancient tower of the Foraboschi family (the tower then known as ""La Vacca"" or ""The Cow"") into the new tower's facade as its substructure;[1] this is why the rectangular tower (height 94 m) is not directly centered in the building. This tower contains two small cells, that, at different times, imprisoned Cosimo de' Medici (the Elder) (1435) and Girolamo Savonarola (1498). The tower is named after its designer Torre d'Arnolfo. The tower's large, one-handed clock was originally constructed in 1353 by the Florentine Nicolò Bernardo, but was replaced in 1667 with a replica made by Georg Lederle from the German town of Augsburg (Italians refer to him as Giorgio Lederle of Augusta) and installed by Vincenzo Viviani.
Duke Cosimo I de' Medici (later to become grand duke) moved his official seat from the Medici palazzo in via Larga to the Palazzo della Signoria in May 1540, signalling the security of Medici power in Florence.[2] When Cosimo later removed to Palazzo Pitti, he officially renamed his former palace the Palazzo Vecchio, the ""Old Palace"", although the adjacent town square, the Piazza della Signoria, still bears the original name. Cosimo commissioned Giorgio Vasari to build an above-ground walkway, the Vasari corridor, from the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, over the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. Cosimo I also moved the seat of government to the Uffizi.
The palace gained new importance as the seat of united Italy's provisional government from 1865 to 1871, at a moment when Florence had become the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Although most of the Palazzo Vecchio is now a museum, it remains as the symbol and center of local government; since 1872 it has housed the office of the mayor of Florence, and it is the seat of the City Council. The tower currently has three bells; the oldest was cast in the 13th century.";"The town hall of Florence, Italy, overlooks the Piazza della Signoria, which holds a copy of Michelangelo's David statue, and the gallery of statues in the adjacent Loggia dei Lanzi.£ It is situated in the Santa Croce district.£
Originally named the Palazzo della Signoria after Florence's ruling body, the building has been known by other names such as Palazzo del Popolo, Palazzo dei Priori, and Palazzo Ducale, reflecting its diverse roles throughout history.£ It became known as Palazzo Vecchio when the Medici moved their residence to the Palazzo Pitti across the Arno River.£
In 1299, Florence's commune decided to construct a palace to reflect the city’s prominence and provide a secure seat for its magistrates.£ Designed by Arnolfo di Cambio, the architect of the Duomo and Santa Croce, it was built on the ruins of the Uberti family's properties.£ Historian Giovanni Villani noted that the Uberti were ""rebels of Florence and Ghibellines,"" and the site was chosen to prevent the family from rebuilding.£
The building is made of solid, rusticated stone with two rows of Gothic two-lighted windows featuring trefoil arches.£ In the 15th century, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi added bas-reliefs of the cross and Florentine lily between the arches.£ It is crowned with crenellated battlements supported by arches and corbels.£ Under the arches are painted coats of arms of the Florentine republic.£ Some arches also served as embrasures for defensive purposes.£
The clock tower, named Torre d'Arnolfo after its designer, rises to 94 meters.£ It incorporates an older tower and is not centered in the building.£ The tower’s cells once held notable prisoners, including Cosimo de’ Medici (1435) and Girolamo Savonarola (1498).£ Its original clock, installed in 1353, was replaced in 1667 by a replica made by Georg Lederle of Augsburg.£
In 1540, Duke Cosimo I de' Medici moved his official seat to the Palazzo della Signoria, signifying Medici power.£ After relocating to the Palazzo Pitti, he renamed his former residence the Palazzo Vecchio.£";Piazza della Signoria;Santa Croce;Arnolfo di Cambio, Michelozzo Michelozzi ;Gothic;Church;[ ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'type', 'town hall'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'located in', 'Florence'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'overlooks', 'Piazza della Signoria'], ['Piazza della Signoria', 'holds', 'copy of Michelangelo\'s David statue'], ['Piazza della Signoria', 'contains', 'gallery of statues'], ['Gallery of statues', 'located in', 'Loggia dei Lanzi'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'situated in', 'district of Santa Croce'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'originally called', 'Palazzo della Signoria'], ['Palazzo della Signoria', 'named after', 'Signoria of Florence'], ['Signoria of Florence', 'ruling body of', 'Republic of Florence'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'also known as', 'Palazzo del Popolo'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'also known as', 'Palazzo dei Priori'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'also known as', 'Palazzo Ducale'], ['Building', 'acquired current name when', 'Medici duke\'s residence moved'], ['Medici duke\'s residence', 'moved to', 'Palazzo Pitti'], ['In 1299, Florence', 'decided to build', 'palace'], ['Arnolfo di Cambio', 'began construction of', 'Palazzo Vecchio'], ['Arnolfo di Cambio', 'architect of', 'Duomo and Santa Croce church'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'built on', 'ruins of Palazzo dei Fanti'], ['Palazzo dei Fanti', 'owned by', 'Uberti family'], ['Giovanni Villani', 'wrote in', 'Nuova Cronica'], ['Uberti family', 'called', 'rebels of Florence and Ghibellines'], ['Building', 'made of', 'solid rusticated stonework'], ['Building', 'features', 'two rows of Gothic windows'], ['Windows', 'each have', 'trefoil arch'], ['Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi', 'added', 'decorative bas-reliefs'], ['Bas-reliefs', 'include', 'cross and Florentine lily'], ['Building', 'crowned with', 'crenellated battlements'], ['Battlements', 'supported by', 'small arches and corbels'], ['Under arches', 'are', 'series of nine painted coats of arms'], ['Giovanni Villani', 'stated that', 'ancient tower incorporated into facade'], ['Ancient tower', 'known as', 'La Vacca'], ['La Vacca', 'integrated into', 'Torre d\'Arnolfo'], ['Torre d\'Arnolfo', 'named after', 'designer'], ['Torre d\'Arnolfo', 'height', '94 m'], ['Tower', 'contains', 'two small cells'], ['Cells', 'imprisoned', 'Cosimo de\' Medici'], ['Cells', 'imprisoned', 'Girolamo Savonarola'], ['Original clock', 'constructed in', '1353'], ['Original clock', 'replaced in', '1667'], ['Giorgio Lederle', 'made', 'clock replica'], ['Clock replica', 'installed by', 'Vincenzo Viviani'], ['Duke Cosimo I de\' Medici', 'moved official seat to', 'Palazzo della Signoria'], ['Cosimo I de\' Medici', 'renamed palace to', 'Palazzo Vecchio'], ['Giorgio Vasari', 'commissioned to build', 'Vasari corridor'], ['Vasari corridor', 'connects', 'Palazzo Vecchio and Palazzo Pitti'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'seat of', 'united Italy\'s provisional government'], ['Government seat time period', 'from', '1865 to 1871'], ['Florence', 'became temporary capital', 'Kingdom of Italy'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'functions as', 'symbol and center of local government'], ['Since 1872, Palazzo Vecchio', 'housed office of', 'mayor of Florence'], ['Palazzo Vecchio', 'seat of', 'City Council'], ['Tower', 'currently has', 'three bells'], ['Oldest bell', 'cast in', '13th century'] ]
Galleria degli Uffizi;"The Uffizi Gallery Italian: Galleria degli Uffizi, pronounced is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the district Santa Croce. One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best-known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance. T
After the ruling House of Medici died out, their art collections were given to the city of Florence under the famous Patto di famiglia negotiated by Anna Maria Luisa, the last Medici heiress. The Uffizi is one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1769 it was officially opened to the public, formally becoming a museum in 1865.[4] The building of the Uffizi complex was begun by Giorgio Vasari in 1560 for Cosimo I de' Medici as a means to consolidate his administrative control of the various committees, agencies, and guilds established in Florence's Republican past so as to accommodate them all one place, hence the name uffizi, ""offices"". Instead of dark, cramped and unhealthy spaces, Vasari had created a spacious and luminous square. The style adopted is classical - Doric - which alludes to the fairness of the Prince's government. The construction was later continued by Alfonso Parigi and Bernardo Buontalenti; it was completed in 1581. The top floor was made into a gallery for the family and their guests and included their collection of Roman sculptures. The cortile (internal courtyard) is so long, narrow, and open to the Arno at its far end through a Doric screen that articulates the space without blocking it, that architectural historians[6] treat it as the first regularized streetscape of Europe. Vasari, a painter, and architect as well, emphasized its perspective length by adorning it with the matching facades' continuous roof cornices, and unbroken cornices between storeys, as well as the three continuous steps on which the museum fronts stand. The niches in the piers that alternate with columns of the Loggiato are filled with sculptures of famous artists in the 19th century.

The Uffizi brought together under one roof the administrative offices and the Archivio di Stato, the state archive. The project was intended to display prime artworks of the Medici collections on the piano nobile; the plan was carried out by his son, Grand Duke Francesco I. He commissioned the architect Buontalenti to design the Tribuna degli Uffizi that would display a series of masterpieces in one room, including jewels; it became a highly influential attraction of a Grand Tour. The octagonal room was completed in 1584.[7]
Over the years, more sections of the building were recruited to exhibit paintings and sculptures collected or commissioned by the Medici. For many years, 45 to 50 rooms were used to display paintings from the 13th to 18th century.[8]";"The Uffizi Gallery (Italian: Galleria degli Uffizi) is a prominent art museum located adjacent to the Piazza della Signoria in the district of Santa Croce.£ One of the most important Italian museums and the most visited, it is also one of the largest and best-known in the world and holds a collection of priceless works, particularly from the period of the Italian Renaissance.£

Basilica Santa Croce;"The Basilica di Santa Croce (Italian for 'Basilica of the Holy Cross') is a minor basilica and the principal Franciscan church of Florence, Italy. It is situated on the Piazza di Santa Croce, about 800 metres southeast of the Duomo, on what was once marshland beyond the city walls. Being the burial place of notable Italians, including those from the Italian Renaissance such as Michelangelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli, as well as the poet Foscolo, political philosopher Gentile and the composer Rossini, it is also known as the Temple of the Italian Glories (Tempio dell'Itale Glorie). The basilica is the largest Franciscan church in the world. Its most notable features are its sixteen chapels, many of them decorated with frescoes by Giotto and his pupils,[a] and its tombs and cenotaphs. Legend says that Santa Croce was founded by St Francis himself. The construction of the current church, to replace an older building, was begun on 12 May 1294,[2] possibly by Arnolfo di Cambio, and paid for by some of the city's wealthiest families. It was consecrated in 1442 by Pope Eugene IV. The building's design reflects the austere approach of the Franciscans. The floorplan is an Egyptian or Tau cross (a symbol of St Francis), 115 metres in length with a nave and two aisles separated by lines of octagonal columns. To the south of the church was a convent, some of whose buildings remain. The Basilica di Santa Croce is mixed style of gothic, renaissance and gothic revival. 
The Primo Chiostro, the main cloister, houses the Cappella dei Pazzi, built as the chapter house, completed in the 1470s. Filippo Brunelleschi (who had designed and executed the dome of the Duomo) was involved in its design which has remained rigorously simple and unadorned.
In 1560, the choir screen was removed as part of changes arising from the Counter-Reformation and the interior of this area was rebuilt by Giorgio Vasari. As a result, there was damage to the church's decoration and most of the altars previously located on the screen were lost. The Bardi Chapel which contained a cycle of frescoes of the life of St Francis was plastered over, at the behest of Cosimo I, and Vasari placed some new altars against the walls, causing considerable damage to the frescoes.[3]
The bell tower was built in 1842, replacing an earlier one damaged by lightning. The neo-Gothic marble façade dates from 1857 to 1863. The Jewish architect Niccolò Matas from Ancona designed the church's façade, working a prominent Star of David into the composition. Matas had wanted to be buried with his peers but because he was Jewish, he was buried under the threshold and honoured with an inscription.
In 1866, the complex became public property, as a part of government suppression of most religious houses, following the wars that gained Italian independence and unity.[4][5]
Among the 19th-century restorations, the 16th-century altars and plaster were removed from the Bardi Chapel, revealing Giotto's frescoes of the Life of St Francis, which include the Death of St. Francis. This painting, missing sections where an altar had been attached to the wall, was heavily restored in the 19th century. These restorations were later removed to reveal those areas which are definitively Giotto's, leaving portions of the painting missing.[6]
The Museo dell'Opera di Santa Croce is housed mainly in the refectory, also off the cloister. A monument to Florence Nightingale stands in the cloister, in the city in which she was born and after which she was named. Brunelleschi also built the inner cloister, completed in 1453.
In 1940, during the safe hiding of various works during World War II, Ugo Procacci noticed the Badia Polyptych being carried out of the church. He reasoned that this had been removed from the Badia Fiorentina during the Napoleonic occupation and accidentally re-installed in Santa Croce.[7] Between 1958 and 1961, Leonetto Tintori removed layers of whitewash and overpaint from Giotto's Peruzzi Chapel scenes to reveal his original work.[1]
In 1966, the Arno River flooded much of Florence, including Santa Croce. The water entered the church bringing mud, pollution and heating oil. The damage to buildings and art treasures was severe, taking several decades to repair.

Basilica di San Lorenzo;"The Basilica di San Lorenzo (Basilica of St. Lawrence) is one of the largest churches of Florence, Italy, situated at the centre of the main market district of the city, and it is the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III. It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD,[1] at which time it stood outside the city walls. For three hundred years it was the city's cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.
San Lorenzo was the parish church of the Medici family. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici offered to finance a new church to replace an eleventh-century Romanesque rebuilding. Filippo Brunelleschi, the leading Renaissance architect of the first half of the fifteenth century, was commissioned to design it, but the building, with alterations, was not completed until after his death. The church is part of a larger monastic complex that contains other important architectural and artistic works: the Old Sacristy (""Sagresta Vecchia"") by Brunelleschi and having interior decoration and sculpture by Donatello; the Laurentian Library by Michelangelo; the Medici Chapels, two structures that include the New Sacristy (""Sagrestia Nuova"") based on Michelangelo's designs; and the larger Cappella dei Principi (""Chapel of the Princes"") being a collaboration between the family and architects. The Basilica of San Lorenzo is considered a milestone in the development of Renaissance architecture. The basilica has a complicated building history. The project was begun around 1419, under the direction of Filippo Brunelleschi. Lack of funds slowed the construction and forced changes to the original design. By the early 1440s, only its sacristy (now called the Old Sacristy) had been worked on because that was being paid for by the Medici. In 1442, the Medici stepped in to take over financial responsibility of the church as well. After Brunelleschi's death in 1446, the job was handed either to Antonio Manetti or Michelozzo; scholars are uncertain which. Although the building was largely completed by 1459 in time for a visit to Florence by Pius II, the chapels along the right-hand aisles were still under construction during the 1480s and 1490s.
By the time the building was completed, aspects of its layout and detailing no longer corresponded to the original plan. The principal difference is that Brunelleschi had envisioned the chapels along the side aisles to be deeper than those built and he intended them to resemble the chapels in the transept, the only part of the building that is known to have been completed as Brunelleschi designed it.[2]";"The Basilica di San Lorenzo (Basilica of St. Lawrence) is one of the largest churches of Florence, Italy, situated at the centre of the main market district of the city, and it is the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III.£ It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD, at which time it stood outside the city walls.£ For three hundred years, it was the city's cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.£

By the time the building was completed, aspects of its layout and detailing no longer corresponded to the original plan.£ The principal difference is that Brunelleschi had envisioned the chapels along the side aisles to be deeper than those built, and he intended them to resemble the chapels in the transept, the only part of the building that is known to have been completed as Brunelleschi designed it.£";Piazza di San Lorenzo;San Giovanni;Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Donatello, Michelozzo;  Renaissance;;[ ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'type', 'minor basilica'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'principal church of', 'Franciscans in Florence'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'located on', 'Piazza di Santa Croce'], ['Piazza di Santa Croce', 'located 800 meters southeast of', 'Duomo'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'known as', 'Temple of the Italian Glories'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'burial place of', 'notable Italians'], ['Notable Italians', 'include', 'Michelangelo'], ['Notable Italians', 'include', 'Galileo'], ['Notable Italians', 'include', 'Machiavelli'], ['Notable Italians', 'include', 'poet Foscolo'], ['Notable Italians', 'include', 'philosopher Gentile'], ['Notable Italians', 'include', 'composer Rossini'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'largest Franciscan church in', 'world'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'features', 'sixteen chapels'], ['Chapels', 'decorated with frescoes by', 'Giotto and pupils'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'founded by', 'St Francis (legend)'], ['Construction began', 'on', '12 May 1294'], ['Construction possibly by', 'Arnolfo di Cambio'], ['Construction', 'funded by', 'wealthiest families'], ['Basilica', 'consecrated in', '1442'], ['Consecration by', 'Pope Eugene IV'], ['Design reflects', 'austere approach of Franciscans'], ['Floorplan', 'shape', 'Egyptian or Tau cross'], ['Church length', '115 meters'], ['Church features', 'nave and two aisles'], ['Aisles separated by', 'lines of octagonal columns'], ['South of church', 'was a', 'convent'], ['Basilica di Santa Croce', 'style', 'Gothic, Renaissance and Gothic Revival'], ['Primo Chiostro', 'houses', 'Cappella dei Pazzi'], ['Cappella dei Pazzi', 'built as', 'chapter house'], ['Cappella dei Pazzi', 'completed in', '1470s'], ['Filippo Brunelleschi', 'involved in', 'Cappella dei Pazzi design'], ['Choir screen', 'removed in', '1560'], ['Interior rebuilt by', 'Giorgio Vasari'], ['Bardi Chapel', 'contained', 'frescoes of life of St Francis'], ['Bardi Chapel frescoes', 'plastered over by', 'Cosimo I\'s behest'], ['Bell tower', 'built in', '1842'], ['Neo-Gothic façade', 'dates from', '1857 to 1863'], ['Façade designed by', 'Niccolò Matas'], ['Niccolò Matas', 'included', 'Star of David'], ['Complex became public property', 'in', '1866'], ['Bardi Chapel', 'Giotto\'s frescoes', 'revealed in 19th century'], ['Museo dell\'Opera di Santa Croce', 'housed in', 'refectory'], ['Monument to', 'Florence Nightingale in cloister'], ['Brunelleschi', 'built', 'inner cloister'], ['Inner cloister', 'completed in', '1453'], ['In 1966, Arno River', 'flooded Florence and Santa Croce'], ['Former dormitory', 'houses', 'Scuola del Cuoio'], ['Scuola del Cuoio', 'artisans craft', 'leather goods'] ]
Duomo di Firenze;"Florence Cathedral (Italian: Duomo di Firenze), formally the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower (Italian: Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore [katteˈdraːle di ˈsanta maˈriːa del ˈfjoːre]), is the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Florence. Commenced in 1296 in the Gothic style to a design of Arnolfo di Cambio and structurally completed by 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi;[1] the basilica's exterior is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, and features an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival (west) façade by Emilio De Fabris. 
The cathedral complex, in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile, it is present in the district San Giovanni. These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major tourist attraction of Tuscany. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches and its dome, when first built back in the 15th century, was the largest ever built in western Europe. Although it was later overtaken by St Peter's Basilica, it still remains the largest dome ever constructed of bricks. The cathedral is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Florence, whose archbishop is Gherardo Gambelli.[2] Santa Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence's second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparata;[3] the first was the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze, the first building of which was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. Ambrose of Milan.[4] The ancient structure, founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs, was crumbling with age, according to the 14th-century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani,[5] and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city.[5] Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period, such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed.
The city council approved Arnolfo di Cambio's design for the new church in 1294.[6] Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio.[7][8] He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome, with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata. The first stone was laid on 9 September 1296, by Cardinal Valeriana, the first papal legate ever sent to Florence. The building of this vast project was to last 140 years; Arnolfo's plan for the eastern end, although maintained in concept, was greatly expanded in size.
After Arnolfo died in 1302, work on the cathedral slowed for almost 50 years. When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata, the project gained a new impetus. In 1331, the Arte della Lana, the guild of wool merchants, took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work. Assisted by Andrea Pisano, Giotto continued di Cambio's design. His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile. When Giotto died on 8 January 1337, Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348.

In 1349, action resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects, starting with Francesco Talenti, who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels. In 1359, Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini (1360–1369) who divided the centre nave in four square bays. Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi, Giovanni d'Ambrogio, Neri di Fioravanti and Andrea Orcagna. By 1375, the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down. The nave was finished by 1380, and only the dome remained incomplete until 1436.
On 19 August 1418,[9] the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri's dome. The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi, the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici. Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp. Brunelleschi won and received the commission.[10]
Ghiberti, appointed coadjutor, drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi's and, though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins, was promised equal credit, although he spent most of his time on other projects. When Brunelleschi became ill, or feigned illness, the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti. But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him. In 1423, Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility.[11]
Erection of the dome had begun in 1420 and was finished in 1436. The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on 25 March 1436, the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar. It was the first 'octagonal' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame. During the consecration in 1436, Guillaume Dufay's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed.
The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral, begun in the 14th century, was left unfinished after the initial works done by Arnolfo di Cambio, which led Lorenzo de' Medici to initiate a design competition for the façade between 1490 and 1491.[12] The competition went ultimately nowhere, and the façade was not completed until 1887, when the polychrome marble façade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris. The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century.
The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara (white), Prato (green), Siena (red), Lavenza and a few other places. These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto's Bell Tower. There are two side doors: the Doors of the Canonici (south side) and the Door of the Mandorla (north side) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco, Donatello, and Jacopo della Quercia. The six side windows, notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments, are separated by pilasters. Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light; the other two are merely ornamental.

Bargello;"The Bargello, also known as the Palazzo del Bargello or Palazzo del Popolo (""Palace of the People""), is a former barracks and prison in Florence, Italy. Since 1865, it has housed the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, a national art museum. The architectural style is Gothic,  The first nucleus, facing Via del Proconsolo, already begun in 1255 (forty-three years before the Palazzo della Signoria), was built according to Giorgio Vasari by Lapo Tedesco next to the tower known as the Volognana, formerly belonging to the Boscoli family, and on some houses and towers of the Badia Fiorentina[1]. The Bargello is locate on the district of San Giovanni in the Via del Proconsolo, via Ghibellina, via dell'Acqua, via della Vigna Vecchia.

Construction began in 1255. The palace was built to house first the Capitano del Popolo and later, in 1261, the 'podestà', the highest magistrate of the Florence City Council. This Palazzo del Podestà, as it was originally called, is the oldest public building in Florence. This austere crenellated building served as model for the construction of the Palazzo Vecchio. In 1574, the Medici dispensed with the function of the Podestà and housed the bargello, the police chief of Florence, in this building, hence its name.[1] It was employed as a prison; executions took place in the Bargello's yard until they were abolished by Grand Duke Peter Leopold in 1786, but it remained the headquarters of the Florentine police until 1859. When Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor Peter Leopold was exiled, the makeshift Governor of Tuscany decided that the Bargello should no longer be a jail, and it then became a national museum.
The original two-story structure was built alongside the Volognana Tower in 1256. The third storey, which can be identified by the smaller blocks used to construct it, was added after the fire of 1323. The building is designed around an open courtyard with an external staircase leading to the second floor. An open well is found in the centre of the courtyard.[1]

Santa Felicita;"Santa Felicita (Church of St Felicity) is a Roman Catholic church in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy, probably the oldest in the city after San Lorenzo. In the 2nd century, Syrian Greek merchants settled in the area south of the Arno and are thought to have brought Christianity to the region. The first church on the site was probably built in the late 4th century or early 5th century and was dedicated to Saint Felicity of Rome. A new church was built in the 11th century and the current church largely dates from 1736–1739, under design by Ferdinando Ruggieri, who turned it into a one nave edifice. The monastery was suppressed under the Napoleonic occupation of 1808–1810.  The Vasari Corridor passes through the façade of this church and on the inside there is large window, covered by a thick gate, where the Grand Dukes of the Medici family used to listen to the mass without being seen by the people staying at ground level. In the piazza in front of the façade, stands the rebuilt 15th-century Column of Santa Felicita. Only the 14th century Chapter House survives from the Romanesque with fragmentary frescoes (1387) by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini (Crucifixion and in the ceiling, roundels with the Redeemer and the Seven Virtues).  The Brunelleschian sacristy dates from 1473 and was under the patronage of the Canigiani family. There are the 14th century Madonna with Child and Saints by Taddeo Gaddi, the 15th century Adoration of the Magi by Francesco d'Antonio and St. Felicity with Her Seven Sons by Neri di Bicci.  The Barbadori (or Capponi) chapel dates also to the 15th century (1419–1423); it was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi and when the patronage passed to Lodovico di Gino Capponi the decoration was entrusted to Pontormo, who worked on it from 1525 until 1528. The painting of the vault has disappeared but in the chapel can still be seen the Four Evangelists in the pendentives and two of the greatest masterpieces by Pontormo: the Virgin and the Angel Gabriel on the side wall and the altarpiece of the Deposition above the end altar. The latter, enclosed in its gilded fame, with its surrealistic dimensions of elongated and entangled bodies and its range of iridescent colours, constitutes one of the most important works of Early Mannerism. The stained glass window depicting the Journey to the Sepulchre is a copy of the one done by Guglielmo da Marcillat in 1526.  The desire to create a complementary space to this led to the decoration of the opposite Canigiani chapel by Bernardino Poccetti (Miracle of Our Lady of the Snow, 1589–1590). In 1565, as recorded by Vasari himself, Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided to build the long corridor which would connect the old Priors' Palace in Piazza della Signoria with the new Medici residence, previously property of the Pitti family; as this would pass through the church of Santa Felicita, the church began to play a very important role in the life of the Medici court. Cigoli was responsible for the design of the chancel whose patrons were the Guicciardini family (and where the famous historian Francesco was buried in 1540). The work continued until the vault was decorated by Cinganelli (c. 1620); on the altar is the Adoration of the Shepherds attributed to Francesco Brina (1587).  In the church there are also the Martyrdom of the Maccabees (1863) by Antonio Ciseri in the 3rd chapel on the right, the Meeting of St. Anne and St. Joachim, attributed to Michele Tosini, at the end of the right transept, the Assumption of the Virgin with Saints (1677), attributed to Baldassare Franceschini, at the end of the left transept. In the Caponni chapel you can see The Deposition from the Cross (1528) by Jacopo Pontormo one of Pontormo's surviving masterpieces.  The sacristy has a painted crucifix (circa 1310) attributed to Pacino di Buonaguida.";"Santa Felicita (Church of St Felicity) is a Roman Catholic church in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy, probably the oldest in the city after San Lorenzo. £ In the 2nd century, Syrian Greek merchants settled in the area south of the Arno and are thought to have brought Christianity to the region. £ The first church on the site was probably built in the late 4th century or early 5th century and was dedicated to Saint Felicity of Rome. £

The Vasari Corridor passes through the façade of this church and on the inside there is large window, covered by a thick gate, where the Grand Dukes of the Medici family used to listen to the mass without being seen by the people staying at ground level. £ In the piazza in front of the façade, stands the rebuilt 15th-century Column of Santa Felicita. £ Only the 14th century Chapter House survives from the Romanesque with fragmentary frescoes (1387) by Niccolò di Pietro Gerini (Crucifixion and in the ceiling, roundels with the Redeemer and the Seven Virtues). £
The Brunelleschian sacristy dates from 1473 and was under the patronage of the Canigiani family. £ There are the 14th century Madonna with Child and Saints by Taddeo Gaddi, the 15th century Adoration of the Magi by Francesco d'Antonio and St. Felicity with Her Seven Sons by Neri di Bicci. £
The Barbadori (or Capponi) chapel dates also to the 15th century (1419–1423); it was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi and when the patronage passed to Lodovico di Gino Capponi the decoration was entrusted to Pontormo, who worked on it from 1525 until 1528. £ The painting of the vault has disappeared but in the chapel can still be seen the Four Evangelists in the pendentives and two of the greatest masterpieces by Pontormo: the Virgin and the Angel Gabriel on the side wall and the altarpiece of the Deposition above the end altar. £
The latter, enclosed in its gilded frame, with its surrealistic dimensions of elongated and entangled bodies and its range of iridescent colours, constitutes one of the most important works of Early Mannerism. £ The stained glass window depicting the Journey to the Sepulchre is a copy of the one done by Guglielmo da Marcillat in 1526. £
The desire to create a complementary space to this led to the decoration of the opposite Canigiani chapel by Bernardino Poccetti (Miracle of Our Lady of the Snow, 1589–1590). £
In 1565, as recorded by Vasari himself, Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided to build the long corridor which would connect the old Priors' Palace in Piazza della Signoria with the new Medici residence, previously property of the Pitti family; as this would pass through the church of Santa Felicita, the church began to play a very important role in the life of the Medici court. £
Cigoli was responsible for the design of the chancel whose patrons were the Guicciardini family (and where the famous historian Francesco was buried in 1540). £ The work continued until the vault was decorated by Cinganelli (c. 1620); on the altar is the Adoration of the Shepherds attributed to Francesco Brina (1587). £
In the church there are also the Martyrdom of the Maccabees (1863) by Antonio Ciseri in the 3rd chapel on the right, the Meeting of St. Anne and St. Joachim, attributed to Michele Tosini, at the end of the right transept, the Assumption of the Virgin with Saints (1677), attributed to Baldassare Franceschini, at the end of the left transept. £
In the Caponni chapel you can see The Deposition from the Cross (1528) by Jacopo Pontormo, one of Pontormo's surviving masterpieces. £ The sacristy has a painted crucifix (circa 1310) attributed to Pacino di Buonaguida. £";x;x;x;x;x;[ ['Santa Felicita', 'type', 'Roman Catholic church'], ['Santa Felicita', 'located in', 'Florence'], ['Florence', 'region', 'Tuscany'], ['Santa Felicita', 'oldest church after', 'San Lorenzo'], ['Syrian Greek merchants', 'settled in', 'area south of the Arno'], ['Syrian Greek merchants', 'brought', 'Christianity to region'], ['First church', 'built in', 'late 4th or early 5th century'], ['First church', 'dedicated to', 'Saint Felicity of Rome'], ['New church', 'built in', '11th century'], ['Current church', 'dates from', '1736–1739'], ['Ferdinando Ruggieri', 'designed', 'current church'], ['Ferdinando Ruggieri', 'turned church into', 'one nave edifice'], ['Monastery', 'suppressed under', 'Napoleonic occupation'], ['Napoleonic occupation', 'occurred in', '1808–1810'], ['Vasari Corridor', 'passes through', 'façade of church'], ['Grand Dukes of Medici family', 'listened to', 'mass without being seen'], ['Column of Santa Felicita', 'located in', 'piazza in front of façade'], ['Column of Santa Felicita', 'rebuilt in', '15th century'], ['Chapter House', 'survives from', 'Romanesque period'], ['Niccolò di Pietro Gerini', 'created frescoes in', 'Chapter House'], ['Niccolò di Pietro Gerini frescoes', 'include', 'Crucifixion and Seven Virtues'], ['Brunelleschian sacristy', 'dates from', '1473'], ['Brunelleschian sacristy', 'under patronage of', 'Canigiani family'], ['Madonna with Child and Saints', 'painted by', 'Taddeo Gaddi'], ['Adoration of the Magi', 'painted by', 'Francesco d\'Antonio'], ['St. Felicity with Her Seven Sons', 'painted by', 'Neri di Bicci'], ['Barbadori chapel', 'dates to', '1419–1423'], ['Barbadori chapel', 'designed by', 'Filippo Brunelleschi'], ['Patronage', 'passed to', 'Lodovico di Gino Capponi'], ['Decoration', 'entrusted to', 'Pontormo'], ['Pontormo', 'worked on Barbadori chapel from', '1525 until 1528'], ['Pontormo masterpieces', 'include', 'Virgin and Angel Gabriel'], ['Altarpiece of Deposition', 'located in', 'Barbadori chapel'], ['Deposition', 'features', 'elongated and entangled bodies'], ['Stained glass window', 'copy of work by', 'Guglielmo da Marcillat'], ['Decorative work', 'conducted by', 'Bernardino Poccetti'], ['Bernardino Poccetti', 'created', 'Miracle of Our Lady of the Snow'], ['Grand Duke Cosimo I de\' Medici', 'built', 'long corridor in 1565'], ['Corridor', 'intended to connect', 'Priors\' Palace and Medici residence'], ['Chancel', 'designed by', 'Cigoli'], ['Chancel patrons', 'were', 'Guicciardini family'], ['Vault', 'decorated by', 'Cinganelli'], ['Adoration of the Shepherds', 'attributed to', 'Francesco Brina'], ['Martyrdom of the Maccabees', 'painted by', 'Antonio Ciseri'], ['Meeting of St. Anne and St. Joachim', 'attributed to', 'Michele Tosini'], ['Assumption of the Virgin', 'attributed to', 'Baldassare Franceschini'], ['Deposition from the Cross', 'painted by', 'Jacopo Pontormo'], ['Sacristy', 'contains', 'painted crucifix'], ['Crucifix', 'attributed to', 'Pacino di Buonaguida'] ]
The Great Synagogue of Florence ;"The Great Synagogue of Florence (Italian: Tempio Maggiore Israelitico di Firenze) is an Orthodox Jewish congregation and synagogue, that is located at Via Luigi Carlo Farini 4, in Florence, in Tuscany, Italy. Designed in the Italian and Moorish Revival styles, the synagogue was completed in 1882.[1]  The synagogue is one of the largest in south-central Europe and was one of the most important synagogues built in Europe in the age of the Jewish emancipation, reached by the Jewish communities living in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1848.  The Jewish Museum of Florence is located inside the synagogue. In 1848 in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Jewish community were given the status of free citizens. They thought of building a new synagogue to symbolize this change. But only later, could they raise the funds to build such a structure. David Levi, a president of the Jewish community, bequeathed his estate after his death in 1870 to build a new synagogue. The 'Israelitic Temple' was built between 1874 and 1882.  During World War II, Nazis occupied the synagogue, using it as a storehouse. In August 1944 retreating German troops worked with Italian Fascists to lay explosives to destroy the synagogue. However, Italian resistance fighters defused most of the explosives and only a limited amount of damage was done. The synagogue was fully restored after the war. Like many other buildings, it suffered damage after the flood of the River Arno in 1966, but another restoration was undertaken to correct the damage. The Jewish community in Florence comprises approximately 1,400 people. It has a long history, dating from the medieval era. In addition, a nearby Jewish community in the Oltrarno area, south of the Arno river, dates to the Roman era. Jews had a community in Rome since before the Common Era. The first synagogue in Florence was most likely built in the 13th century.[citation needed]  The Great Synagogue of Florence has been widely admired and is a major tourist attraction. It is possible to visit the synagogue on every day, except on Saturdays. The architects were Mariano Falcini [it], Professor Vincenzo Micheli [it], and Marco Treves, who was Jewish. Their design integrated the Italian architectural tradition with the Moorish style used for the decoration. The Moorish Revival style was considered appropriate for a synagogue because it was never used for churches. In the case of the new Synagogue of Florence, it was built in the Sefardic style and served to remind Jews of the origins of Sefardic Jewry in Berber Moorish Spain.  Layers of travertine and granite alternate in the masonry, creating a striped effect. Old photographs show bold red and beige stripes, but the bold colors of the stone have faded over time, leaving a more mottled effect. The overall plan of the synagogue is quadrangular. The central dome raised on pendentives is reminiscent of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, which was built as a Byzantine Empire church, and many mosques were inspired by it. The corner towers are topped with horseshoe-arched towers, which have onion domes in the Moorish Revival style. Three horseshoe arches form the main entrance, above which rise tiers of ajimez windows, with their paired horseshoe arches sharing a single column.[3] The natural copper roof was oxidized to green so that it would stand out in the Florentine skyline.

 Chiesa di San Salvatore di Ognissanti,;"The chiesa di San Salvatore di Ognissanti, or more simply chiesa di Ognissanti, is a Franciscan church located on the piazza of the same name [it] in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. Founded by the lay order of the Umiliati, the church was dedicated to all the saints and martyrs, known and unknown.  It is the burial place of the famous Early Renaissance painter, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Age of Discovery-era explorer Amerigo Vespucci, from whom the name ""America"" is derived. It was completed originally during the 1250s, but almost completely rebuilt around 1627 in Baroque-style by the architect Bartolomeo Pettirossi. Soon after, a new façade (1637) was erected using designs by Matteo Nigetti,[n 2] that conserved the glazed terracotta lunette over the doorway, which while resembling the work of Della Robbia, is now attributed to Benedetto Buglioni. Ognissanti was among the first examples of Baroque architecture to penetrate this Renaissance city. Its three reversed orders of pilasters enclose niches and windows with elaborate cornices. To the left of the façade is a campanile of 13th and 14th century construction.  The Umiliati, by the dedication and probity of the lay brothers and sisters, gained a reputation in Florence, and dedicated works of art began to accumulate in their severely simple church. For example, Giotto's celebrated Madonna and Child with angels (c. 1310) was painted for the high altar.[n 3] Recent cleaning of the Crucifix in the left transept has led this work to be attributed also to Giotto.[n 4] During the sixteenth century, the Umiliati declined in power, and in 1571 the Franciscan order assumed control of the church, and were able to bring to the church precious relics, such as a robe of St Francis of Assisi.  In the early 17th-century, the interior was remodeled in Baroque style, with the apse rebuilt with a pietre dure high altar[n 5] and a sotto in su perspective painting (1770) on the vaulted nave ceiling. Fifteenth-century frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio and Sandro Botticelli were preserved in the nave; Botticelli is buried in the church[n 6] near his beloved Simonetta Vespucci. Botticelli's fresco of St Augustine in His Study faces across the nave the chapel with Ghirlandaio's St Jerome in His Study; both were executed contemporaneously in 1480.  Ghirlandaio also frescoed a version of the Last Supper in the refectory, now a museum, located between the two cloisters, a work which likely influenced Leonardo da Vinci's later work in Milan.  In the Vespucci chapel, a fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio with his brother David, depicting the Madonna della Misericordia protecting members of the Vespucci family (c. 1472), is reputed to include the portrait of Amerigo Vespucci as a child. When Amerigo found a bay in the actual Brazil, he named to ""San Salvatore di Ognissanti"", in Portuguese ""San Salvador de Todos os Santos"": this is the origin of the name of the city of Salvador and Bahia de Todos os Santos.[3]  Over the door to the sacristy is a crucifix in wood by Veit Stoss.";"The chiesa di San Salvatore di Ognissanti, or more simply chiesa di Ognissanti, is a Franciscan church located on the piazza of the same name [it] in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. £ Founded by the lay order of the Umiliati, the church was dedicated to all the saints and martyrs, known and unknown. £ It is the burial place of the famous Early Renaissance painter, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Age of Discovery-era explorer Amerigo Vespucci, from whom the name ""America"" is derived. £

Palazzo Strozzi;"The construction of the palace was begun in 1489 by Benedetto da Maiano, for Filippo Strozzi the Elder, a rival of the Medici who had returned to the city in November 1466 and desired the most magnificent palace to assert his family's continued prominence and, perhaps more important, a political statement of his own status. A great number of other buildings were acquired during the 1470s and demolished to provide enough space for the new construction. Giuliano da Sangallo provided a wood model of the design.[4] Filippo Strozzi died in 1491, long before the construction's completion in 1538. Duke Cosimo I de' Mediciconfiscated it in the same year, not returning it to the Strozzi family until thirty years later.
Palazzo Strozzi is an example of civil architecture with its rusticated stone, inspired by the Palazzo Medici, but with more harmonious proportions. Unlike the Medici Palace, which was sited on a corner lot, and thus has only two sides, this building, surrounded on all four sides by streets, is a free-standing structure. This introduced a problem new in Renaissance architecture, which, given the newly felt desire for internal symmetry of planning symmetry: how to integrate the cross-axis. The ground plan of Palazzo Strozzi is rigorously symmetrical on its two axes, with clearly differentiated scales of its principal rooms.[6]
The palazzo has mullioned paired windows (bifore); the radiating voussoirs of the arches increase in length as they rise to the keystone, a detail that was much copied for arched windows set in rustication in the Renaissance revival. Its dominating cornice is typical of the Florentine palaces of the time.
The palace was left incomplete by Simone del Pollaiolo (il Cronaca), who was in charge of the construction of the palace until 1504. Also by Cronaca is the cortile or central courtyard surrounded by an arcade, inspired by Michelozzo.
Wrought-iron objects known as ferro that adorn the building are famous. Many of these appointments to the building, such as flagpole and torch stands, hitches, lanterns, and sconces decorate the palace exterior and its corners as well as filling functional needs of the day. The ferro on the building were created by an ironsmith, Niccolo Grosso, known as Il Caparra.
The palazzo remained the seat of the Strozzi family until 1937. Great changes were made to the building when the Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni occupied Palazzo Strozzi. The palazzo, granted by the Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni to the Italian State in 1999, is now home to the Institute of Humanist Studies and to the Fondazione Palazzo Strozzi. The Gabinetto G.P. Viesseux and the Renaissance Studies Institute have both also occupied the building since 1940. Today the palace is used for international expositions like fashion shows and other cultural and artistic events, such as ""Cézanne in Florence. Two Collectors and the 1910 Exhibition of Impressionism"". Here also is the seat of the Istituto Nazionale del Rinascimento and the noted Gabinetto Vieusseux, with the library and reading room.";"The construction of the palace was begun in 1489 by Benedetto da Maiano, for Filippo Strozzi the Elder, a rival of the Medici who had returned to the city in November 1466 and desired the most magnificent palace to assert his family's continued prominence and, perhaps more importantly, a political statement of his own status. £ A great number of other buildings were acquired during the 1470s and demolished to provide enough space for the new construction. £ Giuliano da Sangallo provided a wood model of the design. £ Filippo Strozzi died in 1491, long before the construction's completion in 1538. £ Duke Cosimo I de' Medici confiscated it in the same year, not returning it to the Strozzi family until thirty years later. £

Porta Romana;"The Porta Romana, once known as the Porta San Pier Gattolino was the southernmost gate in the 13th-century walls of the Oltrarno section of Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It stands at the confluence of a number of roads: accessed from north by Via Romana, Via de' Serragli, and Viale Francesco Petrarca. In addition, a central road along the Boboli Gardensbegins near the gate, and allowed the inhabitants of the Pitti Palace to exit and enter Florence with minimal travel on city streets. Beyond the gates are the Via del Poggio Imperiale and Via Senese. The latter led to Siena and points south such as Rome, hence the name. When the majority of the defensive walls of Florence were razed in the 19th century, only a few, and sometimes partial gate structures were left standing including San Gallo Gate, Tower of San Niccolò, and this gate with a snippet of merlonated wall.
The 13th century walls and gates of the city were erected with the designs of various builders; among the main contributors were Arnolfo di Cambio, with contributions by Orcagna, Giotto and others. A plaque on the external wall claims the gate was erected in 1327. Originally and as demonstrated on the 1584 Map by Stefano Buonsignori the gate had a lower outer wall with a small courtyard dominated by the larger gate we see today;[1] in this, the gate resembled the Porta Romana of Siena. The gate had a large central entrance for horse-drawn carriages, and smaller lateral doors for pedestrian entry. The door retains its original massive, iron-clad doors. The outer arch has a weather-worn 13th-century fresco, depicting the enthroned Virgin and saints.
The interior portion of the gate has two marble plaques: one commemorates the 1515 entrance into Florence of the Medici Pope Leo X, and the other the 1535 entry of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.
When Cosimo I augmented the walls around Florence, at this site, he destroyed the church of San Pier Gattolino that had stood at the site since at least 1068. A subsequent church was rebuilt, which was restored in 1808, when frescoes of Giuseppe Castagnoli and Domenico Del Podestà were added. The church was decorated by Giusto Mariani and Romanelli. It is said the term Gattolino is a corruption of Gattuario, others say it was a corruption of Catelina. Others attribute it to the Italian word ""gattice"", designating a type of white poplar. The church is also called the parish church of Serumido, derived from the name of Ser Umido di Domenico Grazzini, who helped to fund its rebuilding.
Just outside the wall was the 14th-century church and convent of San Giusto della Calza of the Knights of Jerusalem.[5]

San Minato al monte;"San Miniato al Monte (St. Minias on the Mountain) is a basilica in Florence, central Italy, standing atop one of the highest points in the city. It has been described as one of the finest Romanesque structures in Tuscany and one of the most scenic churches in Italy. There is an adjoining Olivetan monastery, seen to the right of the basilica when ascending the stairs.
St. Miniato or Minas (Armenian: Մինաս) was an Armenian prince serving in the Roman army under Emperor Decius.He was denounced as a Christian after becoming a hermit and was brought before the Emperor who was camped outside the gates of Florence. The Emperor ordered him to be thrown to beasts in the Amphitheatre where a panther was called upon him but refused to devour him. Beheaded in the presence of the Emperor, he is alleged to have picked up his head, crossed the Arno and walked up the hill of Mons Fiorentinus to his hermitage. A shrine was later erected at this spot and there was a chapel there by the 8th century. Construction of the present church was begun in 1013 by Bishop Alibrandoand it was endowed by the Emperor Henry II. The adjoining monastery began as a Benedictine community, then passed to the Cluniacsand then in 1373 to the Olivetans, who still run it. The monks make famous liqueurs, honey and herbal teas, which they sell from a shop next to the church.
The interior exhibits the early feature of a choirraised on a platform above the large crypt. It has changed little since it was first built. The patterned pavement dates from 1207. The centre of the naveis dominated by the beautiful freestanding Cappella del Crocefisso (Chapel of the Crucifix), designed by Michelozzo in 1448. It originally housed the miraculous crucifix now in Santa Trìnita and is decorated with panels long thought to be painted by Agnolo Gaddi. The terracottadecoration of the vault is by Luca della Robbia.
The crypt is the oldest part of the church and the high altar supposedly contains the bones of St Minias himself (although there is evidence that these were removed to Metz before the church was even built). In the vaults are frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi.
The raised choir and presbytery contain a magnificent Romanesque pulpit and screen made in 1207. The apse is dominated by a great mosaic of Christ between the Virgin and St Miniason its vaulted ceiling dating from 1297; the same subject is depicted on the façade of the church and is probably by the same unknown artist. The crucifix above the high altar is attributed to Luca della Robbia. The sacristy is decorated with a great fresco cycle on the Life of St Benedict by Spinello Aretino (1387).
The Cappella del Cardinale del Portogallo to the left of the nave, ""one of the most magnificent funerary monuments of the Italian Renaissance"",[4] was built in 1473 as a memorial to Cardinal James of Lusitania, who died in Florence, to which he was Portuguese ambassador, in 1459. It is the only tomb in the church. The chapel is a collaboration of outstanding artists of Florence: it was designed by Brunelleschi's associate, Antonio Manetti, and finished after his death by Antonio Rossellino. The tomb was made by Antonio and Bernardo Rossellino. The chapel decoration is by Alesso Baldovinetti, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo, and Luca della Robbia.
 The geometrically patterned marble façade was probably begun in about 1090, although the upper parts date from the 12th century or later, financed by the Florentine Arte di Calimala (cloth merchants’ guild), who were responsible for the church's upkeep from 1288. The eagle which crowns the façade was their symbol.
The campanile collapsed in 1499 and was replaced in 1523, although it was never finished. During the siege of Florence in 1530 it was used as an artillery post by the defenders and Michelangelo had it wrapped in mattresses to protect it from enemy fire.
Adjacent to the church is the fine cloister, planned as early as 1426 and built from 1443 to mid-1450s. It was also designed by Bernardo and Antonio Rosselino, and financed by the Arte della Mercantia of Florence,[5] and the fortified bishop's palace, built in 1295 and later used as a barracks and a hospital. The whole complex is surrounded by defensive walls, originally built hastily by Michelangelo during the siege and in 1553 expanded into a true fortress (fortezza) by Cosimo I de' Medici.
The walls now enclose a large ornate monumental cemetery, the Porte Sante, laid out in 1854. Buried there are Carlo Collodi, creator of Pinocchio; politician Giovanni Spadolini; painter Pietro Annigoni; poet and author Luigi Ugolini; film producer Mario Cecchi Gori; sculptor Libero Andreotti; fine artist Maria Luisa Ugolini Bonta; soprano Marietta Piccolomini; writer Giovanni Papini; experimental physicist Bruno Benedetto Rossi; and film director and opera producer Franco Zeffirelli.";"San Miniato al Monte is a basilica in Florence, central Italy, standing atop one of the highest points in the city. £ It has been described as one of the finest Romanesque structures in Tuscany and one of the most scenic churches in Italy. £ There is an adjoining Olivetan monastery, seen to the right of the basilica when ascending the stairs. £

Boboli Gardens;"The Boboli Gardens (Italian: Giardino di Boboli /’bo.bo.li/) is a historical park of the city of Florence that was opened to the public in 1766. Originally designed for the Medici, it represents one of the first and most important examples of the Italian garden, which later served as inspiration for many European courts. Statues of various styles and periods, ancient and Renaissance, dot the garden. It also has large fountains and artificial caves, notably a grotto built by the artist, architect, and sculptor Bernardo Buontalenti between 1536 and 1608.
 
The Gardens, directly behind the Pitti Palace, the main seat of the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany at Florence, are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable ""built"" element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: grottos, nympheums, garden temples and the like. The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties are ever known to have taken place in the gardens.
The Boboli Gardens were laid out for Eleonora di Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici.[1] The name may be a corruption of ""Bogoli""[2] or ""Borgoli"",[3] possibly the name of a family who had previously owned the land.[4] The first stage had scarcely been begun by Niccolò Tribolo[1] when he died in 1550, after which the construction was continued by Bartolomeo Ammanati. Giorgio Vasari contributed to the planning, and Bernardo Buontalenti contributed sculptures,[5] as well as the elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden.
The garden lacks a natural water source. To water its plants, a conduit was built to feed water from the nearby Arno Riverinto an elaborate irrigation system.[1]
The primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep amphitheater;[5] its shape resembles half of a classical hippodrome or racecourse. At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the Ancient Egyptian Boboli obelisk[1]brought from the Villa Medici at Rome. This primary axis terminates in a fountain of Neptune(known to the irreverent Florentines as the ""Fountain of the Fork"" for Neptune's trident); the sculpture of Neptune, by Stoldo Lorenzi, is visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope.
Giulio Parigi laid out the long secondary axis, the Viottolone or Cyprus Road at a right angle to the primary axis. This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the bosquets on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. In 1617, Parigi constructed the Grotto of Vulcan (Grotticina di Vulcano) along this axis.
The gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 450,000 meters² (111 acres).[5] The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works.
In the first phase of building, the amphitheatre was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean (sculpted by Giambologna, later transferred to another location within the same garden). The small Grotto of Madama and the Large Grotto were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.[5]
Even while undergoing restoration work in 2015, the Large Grotto's statues were still on display; they are defining examples of Mannerist sculpture and architecture. Decorated internally and externally with stalactites and originally equipped with waterworks and luxuriant vegetation, the grotto is divided into three main sections. The first one was frescoed to create the illusion of a natural grotto, a refuge that allows shepherds to protect themselves from wild animals; it originally housed The Prisoners of Michelangelo (now replaced by copies), statues that were first intended for the tomb of the Pope Julius II. Other rooms in the Grotto contain Giambologna's famous Bathing Venus and an 18th-century group of Paris and Helen by Vincenzo de' Rossi.
In the hillside above the amphitheatre is a double ramp, leading to the Fountain of Neptune. Its main feature is a large basin with a central bronze statue of Neptune, made by Stoldo Lorenzi some time between 1565 and 1568. The fountain was constructed contemporaneously with its more famous counterpart, Ammannati's Fountain of Neptune, which is at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio at the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. Higher up on the hillside is a statue of Abundance (Dovizia). Collectively, these works seem to allude to a legend in which the gods Athena and Neptune are competing for the role of the patron of Athens. In that legend, Neptune strikes the ground with his trident, causing water to spring forth from it.[6]
The Fontana del Bacchino is a 1560 sculptural work by Valerio Cioli (1529–1599) featuring a statue in the likeness of the famed dwarfbuffoon from the court of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Nano Morgante modeled after Bacchus and riding a tortoise.In 1572 the statue was turned into a fountain.
The Isolotto is an oval-shaped island in a tree-enclosed pond, and is nearly at the end of the alternative Viottolone axis. In the centre of the island is the Fountain of the Ocean, and in the surrounding moat, there are statues of Perseus and Andromeda (school of Giambologna). The Isolotto was laid out by Giulio and Alfonso Parigi, circa 1618.";"The Boboli Gardens is a historical park of the city of Florence that was opened to the public in 1766. £ Originally designed for the Medici, it represents one of the first and most important examples of the Italian garden, which later served as inspiration for many European courts. £ Statues of various styles and periods, ancient and Renaissance, dot the garden. £ It also has large fountains and artificial caves, notably a grotto built by the artist, architect, and sculptor Bernardo Buontalenti between 1536 and 1608. £
The Gardens, directly behind the Pitti Palace, the main seat of the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany at Florence, are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. £ The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable ""built"" element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: grottos, nympheums, garden temples and the like. £ The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. £ The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties are ever known to have taken place in the gardens. £
The Boboli Gardens were laid out for Eleonora di Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici. £ The name may be a corruption of ""Bogoli"" or ""Borgoli,"" possibly the name of a family who had previously owned the land. £ The first stage had scarcely been begun by Niccolò Tribolo when he died in 1550, after which the construction was continued by Bartolomeo Ammanati. £ Giorgio Vasari contributed to the planning, and Bernardo Buontalenti contributed sculptures, as well as the elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden. £
The garden lacks a natural water source. £ To water its plants, a conduit was built to feed water from the nearby Arno River into an elaborate irrigation system. £ The primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep amphitheater; its shape resembles half of a classical hippodrome or racecourse. £
At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the Ancient Egyptian Boboli obelisk, brought from the Villa Medici at Rome. £ This primary axis terminates in a fountain of Neptune (known to the irreverent Florentines as the ""Fountain of the Fork"" for Neptune's trident); the sculpture of Neptune, by Stoldo Lorenzi, is visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope. £
Giulio Parigi laid out the long secondary axis, the Viottolone or Cyprus Road, at a right angle to the primary axis. £ This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the bosquets on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. £ In 1617, Parigi constructed the Grotto of Vulcan (Grotticina di Vulcano) along this axis. £
The gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. £ They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 450,000 meters² (111 acres). £ The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works. £
In the first phase of building, the amphitheater was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. £ Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean (sculpted by Giambologna, later transferred to another location within the same garden). £

Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze;"The Galleria dell'Accademia di Firenze, or ""Gallery of the Academy of Florence"", is an art museum in Florence, Italy. It is best known as the home of Michelangelo's sculpture David. It also has other sculptures by Michelangelo and a large collection of paintings by Florentine artists, mostly from the period 1300–1600 (the Trecento to the Late Renaissance). It is smaller and more specialized than the Uffizi, the main art museum in Florence. It adjoins the Accademia di Belle Artior academy of fine arts of Florence, but despite the name has no other connection with it.
In 2016, it had 1.46 million visitors, making it the second-most-visited art museum in Italy, after the Uffizi (2.02 million).[1]
 
The Galleria dell'Accademia was founded in 1784 by Pietro Leopoldo, Grand Duke of Tuscany.
In 2001 the ""Museo degli strumenti musicali"" collection opened. It includes musical instruments made by Stradivarius, Niccolò Amati and Bartolomeo Cristofori which were acquired by the Florence Conservatory.
In 2023, the museum successfully sued a magazine publisher for using an image of Michelangelo's David without the museum's permission, even though the artwork (which is physically in the museum) belongs to the public domain.[ The museum also objected to GQ Italia using a lenticular cover to switch between an image of the statue and Pietro Boselli.[
The Galleria dell'Accademia has housed the original David by Michelangelo since 1873. The sculpture was allegedly brought to the Accademia for reasons of conservation, although other factors were involved in its move from its previous outdoor location on Piazza della Signoria. The original intention was to create a ""Michelangelo museum"", with original sculptures and drawings, to celebrate the fourth centenary of the artist's birth. Today, the gallery's small collection of Michelangelo's work includes his four unfinished Prisoners, intended for the tomb of Pope Julius II, and a statue of Saint Matthew, also unfinished. In 1939, these were joined by the Palestrina Pietà, discovered in the Barberini chapel in Palestrina, though experts now consider its attribution to Michelangelo to be dubious.
Other works on display are Florentine paintings from the 13th and 16th centuries, including works by Paolo Uccello, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli and Andrea del Sarto; and, from the High Renaissance, Giambologna's original full-size plaster modello for the Rape of the Sabine Women.

Giotto’s Campanile;"Giotto's Campanile is a free-standing campanile (bell tower) that is part of the complex of buildings that make up Florence Cathedral on the Piazza del Duomo in Florence, Italy.
Standing adjacent to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Fiore and the Baptistry of St. John, the tower is one of the showpieces of Florentine Gothic architecture with its design by Giotto, its rich sculptural decorations and its polychromemarble encrustations.
The slender structure is square in plan with 14.45 metre (47.41 ft) sides. It is 84.7 metres (277.9 ft) tall and has polygonal buttresses at each corner.The tower is divided horizontally into five stages.
The lower levels with the hexagonal panels, lozenges and statues.
On the death of Arnolfo di Cambio in 1302, the first Master of the Works of the Cathedral, and after an interruption of more than thirty years, the celebrated painter Giotto di Bondone was nominated as his successor in 1334.[1] At that time he was 67 years old. Giotto concentrated his energy on the design and construction of a campanile for the cathedral. He had become an eminent architect, thanks to the growing autonomy of the architect-designer in relation to the craftsmen since the first half of the 13th century. The first stone was laid on 19 July 1334.[2] His design was in harmony with the polychromy of the cathedral, as applied by Arnolfo di Cambio, giving the tower a view as if it were painted. In his design, he also applied chiaroscuro and some form of perspective instead of a strict linear drawing of the campanile. And instead of a filigree skeleton of a gothic building, he applied a surface of coloured marble in geometric patterns.
When he died in 1337, he had only finished the lower floor with its marble external revetment: geometric patterns of white marble from Carrara, green marble from Prato and red marble from Siena. This lower floor is decorated on three sides with bas-reliefs in hexagonal panels, seven on each side. When the entrance door was enlarged in 1348, two panels were moved to the empty northern side and only much later, five more panels were commissioned from Luca della Robbiain 1437. The number ""seven"" has a special meaning in Biblical sense: it symbolizes human perfectibility.
It is difficult to attribute artistic paternity to these panels. Some may be by Giotto himself, the others by Andrea Pisano (or their workshops).
Through this work, Giotto has become, together with Brunelleschi (dome of the cathedral of Florence) and Alberti (with his treatise De re aedificatoria, 1450), one of the founding fathers of Italian Renaissance architecture.
Giotto was succeeded as Master of the Works in 1343 by Andrea Pisano,[1] famous already for the South Doors of the Baptistery. He continued the construction of the bell tower, scrupulously following Giotto's design. He added, above the lower level of Giotto, a second fascia, this time decorated with lozenge-shaped panels (1347–1341).[dubious – discuss] He built two more levels, with four niches on each side and each level, but the second row of niches are empty. Construction came to a halt in 1348, year of the disastrous Black Death.
Pisano was replaced in his turn by Francesco Talenti who built the top three levels, with the large windows, completing the bell tower in 1359.[1] He did not build the spire designed by Giotto, thus lowering the designed height of 122 metres (400 ft) to 84.7 metres (277.9 ft). The top, with its scenic panorama of Florence and the surrounding hills, can be reached by climbing 414 steps.";"Giotto's Campanile is a free-standing campanile (bell tower) that is part of the complex of buildings that make up Florence Cathedral on the Piazza del Duomo in Florence, Italy. £ Standing adjacent to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Fiore and the Baptistry of St. John, the tower is one of the showpieces of Florentine Gothic architecture with its design by Giotto, its rich sculptural decorations and its polychrome marble encrustations. £

When he died in 1337, he had only finished the lower floor with its marble external revetment: geometric patterns of white marble from Carrara, green marble from Prato, and red marble from Siena. £ This lower floor is decorated on three sides with bas-reliefs in hexagonal panels, seven on each side. £ When the entrance door was enlarged in 1348, two panels were moved to the empty northern side and only much later, five more panels were commissioned from Luca della Robbia in 1437. £ The number ""seven"" has a special meaning in the Biblical sense: it symbolizes human perfectibility. £
It is difficult to attribute artistic paternity to these panels. £ Some may be by Giotto himself, the others by Andrea Pisano (or their workshops). £ Through this work, Giotto has become, together with Brunelleschi (dome of the cathedral of Florence) and Alberti (with his treatise De re aedificatoria, 1450), one of the founding fathers of Italian Renaissance architecture. £
Giotto was succeeded as Master of the Works in 1343 by Andrea Pisano, famous already for the South Doors of the Baptistery. £ He continued the construction of the bell tower, scrupulously following Giotto's design. £ He added, above the lower level of Giotto, a second fascia, this time decorated with lozenge-shaped panels (1347–1341). £ He built two more levels, with four niches on each side and each level, but the second row of niches are empty. £ Construction came to a halt in 1348, the year of the disastrous Black Death. £
Pisano was replaced in his turn by Francesco Talenti who built the top three levels, with the large windows, completing the bell tower in 1359. £ He did not build the spire designed by Giotto, thus lowering the designed height of 122 metres (400 ft) to 84.7 metres (277.9 ft). £ The top, with its scenic panorama of Florence and the surrounding hills, can be reached by climbing 414 steps. £";x;x;x;x;x;[ ['Giotto', 'designed', 'Campanile of Florence Cathedral'], ['Giotto', 'was nominated as', 'Master of the Works of the Cathedral'], ['Giotto', 'started', 'construction of the Campanile'], ['Giotto', 'laid', 'first stone of the Campanile'], ['Giotto', 'finished', 'lower floor of the Campanile'], ['Giotto', 'used', 'geometric marble patterns'], ['Giotto', 'applied', 'chiaroscuro and perspective in his design'], ['Giotto', 'died', '1337'], ['Luca della Robbia', 'was commissioned to create', 'five more panels for the Campanile'], ['Giotto', 'became', 'one of the founding fathers of Italian Renaissance architecture'], ['Giotto', 'was succeeded by', 'Andrea Pisano'], ['Andrea Pisano', 'followed', 'Giotto’s design for the Campanile'], ['Andrea Pisano', 'added', 'second fascia to the Campanile'], ['Andrea Pisano', 'built', 'two more levels of the Campanile'], ['Francesco Talenti', 'completed', 'the top three levels of the Campanile'], ['Francesco Talenti', 'did not build', 'spire designed by Giotto'], ['Francesco Talenti', 'lowered', 'height of the Campanile to 84.7 meters'], ['Giotto', 'designed', 'spire of the Campanile'], ['Francesco Talenti', 'completed', 'Campanile in 1359'], ['Campanile', 'can be reached by', 'climbing 414 steps'] ]
